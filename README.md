#Allure installation

check powershell installed
-$ powershell

$ allure --version

Before building a report you need to run your tests to obtain some basic test report data. Typically it might be a junit-style xml report generated by nearly every popular test framework. For example, suppose you have test reports automatically created by surefire maven plugin stored in the 
target/surefire-reports:

$ allure serve /home/path/to/project/target/surefire-reports/

Which generates a report in temporary folder from the data found in the provided path and then creates a local Jetty server instance, serves generated report and opens it in the default browser.
